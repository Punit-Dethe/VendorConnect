# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vendor-Supplier Platform is a comprehensive digital marketplace designed to streamline the supply chain for India's street food vendors. The platform connects small food vendors with raw material suppliers through a trust-based system, digital contracts, and automated matching algorithms. The system addresses supply chain inefficiencies by providing transparent pricing, reliable delivery tracking, payment guarantees, and a robust trust scoring mechanism for both vendors and suppliers.
