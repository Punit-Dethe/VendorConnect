   - Register a new supplier
   - Verify vendors receive real-time notification

3. **Test Order Workflow**:
   - Login as vendor: `9876543210` / `password123`
   - Go to suppliers page and place an order
   - Login as supplier: `9876543211` / `password123`
   - Check dashboard for real-time order notification
   - Approve/reject the order
   - Verify contract generation

4. **Test Contract Signing**:
   - Go to `/contracts` page
   - View generated contract
   - Sign as both parties

## 🏭 Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string
```

### Docker Deployment

# Dockerfile example
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Database Migration
The system currently uses in-memory storage for rapid development. For production:

1. Replace in-memory arrays with database queries
2. Use PostgreSQL/MySQL with the provided schema
3. Implement connection pooling
4. Add database migrations

### Scaling Considerations
- Use Redis for Socket.IO scaling across multiple servers
- Implement database connection pooling
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Use CDN for static assets

## 🔒 Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (recommended for production)
- SQL injection prevention (when using database)

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics
